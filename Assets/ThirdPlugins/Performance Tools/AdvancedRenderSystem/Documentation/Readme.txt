Hi,

My name is Andrey, I'm the creator of Advanced Render System and I'll show You how to work with my program.

In order to get started with Advanced Render System, click on "Tools / NGSTools / Advanced Render System".

1) Drag and drop Your game camera in "Camera" field.

2) Select the optimum number "Updates Per Frame". This number indicates how many objects will be updated in a single frame. The greater the number - the greater the load on the processor, but the lower the quality of the result. Experiment.

3) "Replace Distance" shows how far should the object is to replace it with a billboard.

4) "Update Angle" - the maximum angle between the camera and billboard before updating.

To see Your selected items, click "Show Selected Objects"

For any questions on this, please e-mail: andre-orsk@yandex.ru

Kindest regards,
Andrey.
