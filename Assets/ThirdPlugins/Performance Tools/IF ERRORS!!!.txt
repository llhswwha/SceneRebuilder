Hi,

If You reading this then You have some problems with my asset.

Most of the errors are related to the Unity Package Manager.
You can solve this by installing the following packages :

	*Burst (tested on version 1.2.3)
	*Mathematics (tested on version 1.1.0)
	*Collections (tested on version 0.6.0)

If You use Unity 2020, please read this :

If it doesn't helps then try to reset dependencies(Help/Reset packages to default)
and reinstall packages.

If You still have some errors, please write in my e-mail(andre-orsk@yandex.ru) and I will help You 
or make a refund for You.

Have a nice day :)
